### What I learned

Getting the card layout right was the main thing I had to think about during this challenge - I used grid, and it worked quite nicely. But, strangely, I found getting all the font sizes right the most difficult (not implying I got it exactly right!)... I guess it isn't so easy to figure out exactly how big the fonts are just from the design screenshots!
